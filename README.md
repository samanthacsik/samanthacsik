### What am I up to? 

🌱 I'm continuouly developing and updating data science trainings and workshops to supplement the curricula of our new [Master of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science/academics-meds) (MEDS) degree program at UC Santa Barbara. All materials are open source, which you can check out on the [MEDS GitHub Organization](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Aworkshop-materials+org%3AUCSB-MEDS+fork%3Atrue&type=repositories).

💜 In my spare time I'm also co-organizer for R-Ladies Santa Barbara -- stay tuned for upcoming events by joining our [Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-barbara/). Past event materials can be found on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_santabarbara). If you're interested in leading or co-leading an event, reach out to me on Twitter!

🥾 My absolute favorite activity is spending time on the trails hiking with my pup, Tallie. I finally got around to scraping my Strava data using the `{rStrava}` package and created a heatmap of my activities using `leaflet` -- check it out on my [personal website](https://samanthacsik.github.io/about.html#fa-hiking-titlea-person-with-a-backpack-and-trekking-pole-the-hobby)! More recently, I've embarked on building a [Strava dashboard](https://samanthacsik.shinyapps.io/strava_dashboard/) to make my map a bit more interactive and also add in some additional fun data viz. It's a work in progress, but feel free to poke around. Find the code for the map and dashboard on my [strava-dashboard repo](https://github.com/samanthacsik/strava-dashboard).
