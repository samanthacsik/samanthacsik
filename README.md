### What am I up to? 

🌱 I'm currently developing data science trainings and workshops to supplement the curricula of our new [Master of Environmental Data Science](https://bren.ucsb.edu/masters-programs/master-environmental-data-science/academics-meds) (MEDS) degree program at UC Santa Barbara. All materials are open source, which you can check out on the [MEDS website](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/workshops.html). 

💜 In my spare time I'm also co-organizer for R-Ladies Santa Barbara -- stay tuned for upcoming events by joining our [Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-santa-barbara/). Past event materials can be found on our [GitHub repo](https://github.com/rladies/meetup-presentations_santabarbara). If you're interested in leading or co-leading an event, reach out to me on Twitter!

🥾 My absolute favorite activity is spending time on the trails hiking with my pup, Tallie. I finally got around to scraping my Strava data using the `{rStrava]` package and plotting an interactive map using `leaflet`. You can check out the map on my [personal website](https://samanthacsik.github.io/about.html) and find the code [here](https://github.com/samanthacsik/strava-hikes). Next step is to figure out a way to beautify all the overlapping markers at my most frequented trailheads.
